**IMPORTANT:** 

Your application should be running over secure connection (HTTPS). 

Do not forget to replace all occurrences of ``localhost`` to the actual domain name of your app.

Do not forget to update ``/server/_config.php``. Files ``_export.php`` and ``async.php`` also contain application-specific variables like path to the uploads folder and path to the template.

## Adding new templates
To add a new template you'll have to create a new folder under /templates/ folder and template.json file. Use default template as an example.
To convert HTML into json you may use the following service:
